BY PROCESS
LoadGame (called by AfterLoad)

LoadPlayers (called by AfterLoad)
	players.xml -- gets the names of the teams, the starting players for each team

	game_events.xml -- gets all of the information about the current atbat or action play

InsertBatter (called by showAction when there is a defensive or offensive substitution or switch or pitching substitution)
	players.xml  -- *** CHANGE THIS TO XDLOAD ONLY ONCE AT THE BEGINNING OF LOADPLAYS AND SAVE IT, BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T CHANGE IN THE MIDDLE OF PLAYS -- THIS MIGHT NOT EVEN CHANGE AT ALL DURING A GAME AND MAYBE COULD BE CALLED ONLY DURING LOADPLAYERS
	boxscore.xml -- *** CHANGE THIS TO XDLOAD ONLY ONCE AT THE BEGINNING OF LOADPLAYS AND SAVE IT, BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T CHANGE IN THE MIDDLE OF PLAYS

BoxScore (at the end of LoadPlays)
	plays.xml -- gets current game status (*** COULD WE GET ELSEWHERE? BUT IT WOULD STILL HAVE TO READ ***) 
	boxscore.xml -- gets the score for displaying in the boxscore box 

IncomingPlayer (called by ShowAction for various events)
	boxscore.xml -- cleans up the player's name *** THIS COULD BE XDLOADED BEFORE THE LOOPING
