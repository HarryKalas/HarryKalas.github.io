event -- what to do or who the player is

Game Advisory
	des: Mound Visit -- maybe put up a message?

Caught Stealing 2B -- player is the one who was caught

Wild Pitch -- player is the one who advances (what if more than one does? if more than one base? you can get the final base from des -- FROM LATER ONE: THE FIRST RUNNER IS THE ONE IDENTIFIED IN PLAYER, BUT THERE MAY BE OTHERS)

Pitching Substitution -- player is incoming pitcher - des gives who they are replacing, where they are batting

Ejection -- player is the person ejected, even if it's a manager -- maybe put up a message?

Passed Ball -- player is the one who advanced (what if more than one advanced? more than one base? you can get the base from des)

Offensive Sub -- player is the one coming in (is it always a pinch hitter? des tells you who the player is replacing)

Defensive Sub -- player is the one coming in, des tells you who they are replacing, where they are batting

THERE SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM WITH DOUBLE SWITCHES -- EASY TO TELL WHO'S COMING IN, HARD TO TELL WHO'S GOING OUT

Defensive Switch -- that's someone moving around, des tells start and end, player is who is moving -- also comes up when a pinch hitter stays in the game, gives fielding position
