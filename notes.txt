	NOT SURE IF i CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS; THE COMMA AT THE END SHOULDN'T BE THERE




I DON'T NEED TO KEEP TRACK OF THE TOTAL OUTS FOR THE INNING BECAUSE THE ATBAT AND ACTION NODES GET THAT -- BUT MAYBE COMPARE TO THE TOTAL I'M STORING

GET THE OUT NUMBER FROM THE PLAY (ATBAT OR ACTION)? NO, THAT WON'T WORK FOR DP

ATBAT AND ACTION ALSO TRACK HOME_TEAM_RUNS AND AWAY_TEAM_RUNS

PLAYS USUALLY COMES BEFORE EVENTS, BUT SOMETIMES BATTER CHANGES BEFORE PLAY -- KEEP TRACK OF PLAY AND DO NOT CALL NEW BATTER UNTIL PREVIOUS BATTER'S PLAY HAS BEEN CALLED

MAYBE SHOW A K COUNT FOR HOME TEAM WHEN HOME TEAM GETS A K?

DON'T NEED TO CALCULATE THE SIDE BECAUSE ATBAT.ID GIVES YOU THAT (HOME OR AWAY)

NEED TO PUT ONLY 1ST PITCHER ON PLAYER NAMES AT BEGINNING AND CHANGE PLAYER NAMES WHEN PITCHER CHANGES
