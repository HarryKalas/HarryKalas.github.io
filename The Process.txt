fundamentally, what calls LoadPlays and LoadPitch and playSound?
	LoadPlays: 
		UpdateIt (directly)
	LoadPitch:
		UpdateIt (on a timer)
	UpdateIt:
		AfterLoad
		GetPlay (in Pitch file, gets called every 5 seconds, but not really; there are a lot of things that directly call GetPlay; )

all the functions (figure out what calls them):
Scorecard:
	xdLoad (lots of calls)
	AfterLoad (called only from HTML)
	UpdateIt (called only from AfterLoad; also called by GetPlay in pitch)
	selectNodes (lots of calls)
	LoadGame (called once from AfterLoad)
	LoadPlayers (called from AfterLoad)
	LoadPlays (called from UpdateIt)
	showPlay (called from LoadPlays)
	SecondaryPlay (called many times from showPlay)
	playerNumber (called many times from showPlay)
	nextBatter (called once from showPlay)
	Fielding (called many times from showPlay)
	HitDetail (called many times from showPlay)
